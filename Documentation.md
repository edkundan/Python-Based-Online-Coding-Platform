3. Technologies Used
Backend:
Java: The project is developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework for building the backend.
Spring Boot: To set up the application structure and handle the HTTP requests, database connectivity, and user authentication.
Spring Security: For user authentication and authorization.
JDBC: To establish connections with MySQL for storing and retrieving user and course data.
MySQL: A relational database for storing user details, course information, and challenge progress.
Frontend:
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
Bootstrap: A front-end framework for responsive design.
JavaScript: For form validation and interactivity on the client side.
Development Tools:
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
Maven: For dependency management and build automation.
MySQL Workbench: For managing MySQL databases.
Git: Version control for the project.
4. Installation Guide
Prerequisites:
JDK 11 or above: Ensure you have Java Development Kit installed on your system.
MySQL: A MySQL server running with access to create databases and tables.
Maven: Make sure you have Apache Maven installed to build the project.
Spring Boot: Ensure you have Spring Boot configured.
Steps to Run the Project:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/edkundan/Python-Based-Online-Coding-Platform
Setup MySQL Database:

Create a new database for the project in MySQL:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE python_learning_platform;
Create the necessary tables by running the provided SQL script in the sql folder:
bash
Copy code
source create_tables.sql;
Configure Application:

Navigate to src/main/resources/application.properties and update the database configuration:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/python_learning_platform
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
Build the Project:

Using Maven, run the following command in your project root directory:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the Project:

Start the Spring Boot application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the platform.
Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.

6. Exception Handling
Custom Exception Class:
Create a custom exception class for handling errors like "UserNotFoundException" or "ChallengeNotFoundException".
Global Exception Handler:
A global exception handler using @ControllerAdvice to handle all exceptions centrally.
7. Bean Validation
User Registration Validation:
Ensure that the user's data (e.g., email, password) is validated before being saved to the database using annotations like @NotNull, @Email, etc.
For example:
java
Copy code
@NotNull
@Email
private String email;
8. Core Feature Implementation
User Registration and Login:
Implement user registration with password hashing using BCryptPasswordEncoder.
Implement user login with session management.
Dashboard:
Display the userâ€™s progress, tutorials, and challenges.
9. Testing
Unit Tests:
Write unit tests for each of the service methods to ensure they work as expected (e.g., UserServiceTest, ChallengeServiceTest).
10. Conclusion
This Python-Based Online Learning Platform serves as a simple yet functional application to help users learn Python programming through tutorials and challenges. It also demonstrates a modern, full-stack approach using Spring Boot, JDBC, and MySQL, with a well-organized project structure, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

11. Future Enhancements
Implement more advanced features like:
Course certification after completion of certain challenges.
Real-time collaborative coding.
Social sharing of progress.
